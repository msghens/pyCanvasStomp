# pyCanvasStomp

Lum5 Glassfish Canvas client


Python replacement for JMSHTTPAdapter_1.0.zip

Problem: 

pyCanvasStomp was developed as a quick hack to solve the issue that student enrollments not being processed by  Canvas.

The basic logic is to check for IMS member records (student enrollment), convert them to Canvas CSV, else pass on the XML.

This script is in production. However, there is still work to be done. 

Future plans

* Create Crosslisted courses
* Debugging

Use at your discretion.
